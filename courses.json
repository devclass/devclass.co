It showed that by using JavaScript fundamentals we could have servers handling tens of thousands of concurrent connections processed very quickly with Google's V8 engine. In this course, we'll learn what exactly Node.js does differently, how to make simple Node.js HTTP apps and various coding patterns for clean asynchronous code.",

Today the browser is fast enough that it is capable of running an application client-side, and simply requesting data (JSON) from the server. This enables our applications to be more interactive and much more scalable. Although it does require the developer to change the way they think, the result is the ability to build immersive applications in ways we were never able to before.",
